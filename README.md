# racingcargame

This README file serves as documentation for users and contributors, providing information about installation, running the code, project structure, and necessary dependencies. 
Additionally, the requirements file (`requirements.txt`) should list all the Python packages needed for the project to run.

Project description:
    This project is based on car racing game, where the maing goal is to avoid getting hit by the incoming traffic.
    There are some PowerUps you can pick to make the game more interesting and a bit easier.


Steps to play the game:
    First, you will need to install some kind of platform where you can run the game, it can be PyCharm, VSCode, or any other that you prefer
    To install the ones that i mentioned you can go to their website click download and thats it

        The website for PyCharm:
        https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

        The website for VSCode:
        https://code.visualstudio.com/download

    Then, to run the code you will need to install Python. There are many versions of it, but i recommend Python 3.11
    You can install it in the windows app store just by searching it´s name and click download.
    This will come with severall packages/libraries but there is one, the most important one, that you will have to download it seperatly, and it´s called pygame.
    To download pygame you first need to also install a tool called pip. 
    Pip will be the responsible to install pygame.
    To download pip you go to your computer terminal and paste this:  curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py 
    Then, right bellow you paste this: python get-pip.py
    After that, open your VSCode, open the project, and in the terminal write this: pip install pygame
    To conclude,make sure that you are on the "main" file of the project, run the code by pressing the play button on the top right corner and it should be working.
    If you have any trouble, verify if you the proper interpreter for the project. In this case it should be the Python 3.11.6 64-bit (Microsot Store).
